* Make installation as VServer.
** Ensure installation proceeds without warnings.
** Ensure trac, project, ez_setup and usr are created inside ${app_root}
** Ensure login link works (/login)
** Ensure attachments work (edit any page and add attachment to check)
** If above checks are OK, we're done.

* Make installation as Directory.
** Perform same tests.

NOTES
-----
Requirements:
 * Python, version >= 2.4.
 * setuptools, version >= 0.6
 * Genshi, version >= 0.6
 * Optionally, Subversion, version >= 1.1.x and the Subversion SWIG
   Python bindings (not PySVN, that's something different).
 * One of the following Python bindings, depending on the database used:
    * pysqlite version 2.x for SQLite 3.x (is part of the standard
      library starting with Python 2.5)
    * psycopg2 version 2.0.x for the PostgreSQL database
    * MySQLdb, version 1.2.2 for the MySQL database
 * A web server capable of executing CGI/FastCGI scripts, or Apache
   HTTPD with mod_python or mod_wsgi. (Trac also comes with a
   standalone server, tracd)

trac-admin queries for;
  project-name: [My Project]
  sql-connection-string (pysqlite by default)

trac.ini must be edited: look for
 (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini)

Installation step takes time. We need to make an intermediate step to avoid re-submissions.


About Sqlite3 and FreeBSD:
Installing the Python dependency for the default Python2.6 interpreter
has been chosen as approach. pysqlite needs sqlite3 installed to build
*BUT* can't find the path to /usr/local/include/sqlite3.h on its own.
