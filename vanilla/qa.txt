* Make installation as VServer.
** Check permissions: ensure installer can proceed without notice (see
   notes about permissions).
** Ensure all main menues are accessible.
** Ensure <user_profile> -> "Change my picture" can upload images.
** Ensure new topics can be created.
* Make installation as Directory.
** Make same tests as for VServer

NOTES
-----
* PHP version 5.2.0 or newer
  file_uploads = on
  PHP Data Objects module
  PDO_MySQL module must be enabled
  GD version 2.0 or newer (optional, but required for profile pictures)
  cURL or Sockets (to allow plugin sandboxing)

* MySQL version 5 or newer

Friendly URLS: when enabled, redirs work as expected, but Vanilla
doesn't unless we make sure ?p or ?q is used.
	Example:    http://example.com/profile/picture?DeliveryType=VIEW ->
	if rewritten as http://example.com/index.php?p=/profile/picture&DeliveryType=VIEW

Beware of the detail: ?p or ?q. It has been changed somewhere among
the line. If redirs fails, try switching that on the test
configuration.
