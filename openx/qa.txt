* Make installation as VServer.
** Check permissions: ensure installer can proceed without notice (see
   notes about permissions).
** Ensure graphs are shown if gd_library is installed.
** If gd not installed, ensure "Missing GD" message is displayed.
** Ensure sections are accessible: Home, Statistics, Inventory, My Account
** No redirections are in place. Not much to check besides permissions.
* Make installation as Directory.
** Make same tests as for VServer

NOTES
-----

Installer neeeds write permissions for openx/var and openx/www/images

The tar.bz2 archive decompressed OK but wouldn't work at
all. Switching to the tar.gz file fixed the situation on 2.8.7.

DB integration: the installation process validates users against their
own web services, and then proceeds to the rest of the config
(including DB info). Their own installer can create the DB.
