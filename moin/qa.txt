* Make installation as VServer.
  ** Ensure StandAlone server is spawned correctly by Cherokee.
  ** Ensure administrator account is correctly created during Market Installation. Log in to see.
  ** Ensure static files are served correctly.
  ** It is proxied: create/edit/delete page. Nothing else to see.

* Make installation as Directory.
  Not at the moment. Took a ridiculous amount of time to figure out

NOTES
-----
Can be installed to run with FasCGI (spawn-fcgi/flup required), SCGI (flup required) or proxied.

SCGI mode fails. Has a hardcoded port, and it has to be patched in
order to make it work on any port (as it should, since it has a
command line parameter)

Proxied approach has less dependencies, but cannot work for Directory installations.
Removed features for Standalone server:
    fix_script_name  = /moin
    X-Moin-Location

Flup is *said* to be included in Moin, but it is not so in 1.9.3 as
can be seen in MoinMoin/web/flup_frontend.py (the contrib/flup-server
code mentioned is not present, although it is in 1.8).

wikiconfig.py file must be created and properly configured. Will patch
it and make appropriate replacements.

For StandAlone mode, Localsettings can be stored in a file called
wikiserverconfig_local.py
    #port = 8080
    #user = ''
    #group = ''

Maybe an initial page should be set rather than the LanguageSetup default one?
