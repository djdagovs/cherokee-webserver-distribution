* Make installation as VServer.
** Perform connection test
* Make installation as Directory.
** Perform same tests.

NOTES
-----
WsgiDAV requires
        * Python version 2.4 or later
        * Optionally lxml (on Python 2.5 it will fall back to xml)
        * Optionally Mercurial (only when checking out source code from the repository)

Steps:
1) Install, create uwsgi's xml file and start it like this:	./uwsgi -x file.xml
2) Map an information source to uwsgi, and a directory to the uWSGI handler.

ATM, to install this we need to get it from Mercurial and have uwsgi
installed on our system. The installer is packing an old ZIP
release. We will have to make connection tests once we settle on a
specific version.

Connection test:
----------------
1) Nautilus -> File -> Connect to server  [non-anonymous connection required. Otherwise it will fail, although docs for beta2 say RW should be available.]
   * Service type: ‘WebDAV (HTTP)’
   * Server: example.com
   * Folder: ‘ro_docs’ or whatever the share name is (leave empty for root share).
   * Port: the port number (leave empty for default port 80)
   * User Name: leave this empty: do not enter anything here.
   Then click ‘Connect’ and enter username and password.

2) Mount a WebDAV file system  [WORKS for anonymous]

$ sudo apt-get install davfs2
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/wsgidav_temp
$ sudo chmod 0766 /mnt/wsgidav_temp
$ sudo mount -t davfs http://192.168.0.2/dav /mnt/wsgidav -o rw
  Please enter the username to authenticate with server
  http://192.168.0.2/dav or hit enter for none.
  Username: tester
  Please enter the password to authenticate user tester with server
  http://192.168.0.2/dav or hit enter for none.
  Password:
$ sudo unmount /mnt/wsgidav

TODO:
-----
Add Authenticated user mappings.
Update release to something better than beta2.
