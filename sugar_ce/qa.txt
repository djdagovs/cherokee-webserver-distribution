* Make installation as VServer.
** Ensure the installation checks can proceed. (They won't if there are permission issues)
** Ensure /emaildelivery.php is not accessible.
** Ensure logfiles are not accessible: /logfile.log (should properly redirect to an html to that effect).
** Ensure all PHP file requests other than those on root directory are redirected to /index.php
** Everything is dispatched from /index.php, so no problems with module accessibility can be foreseen.

* Make installation as Directory.
** Perform same tests
