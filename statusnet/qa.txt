* Make installation as VServer.
** Remove php5-curl from system to see if dependencies are correctly detected.
** Reinstall php5-curl and run our installer.
** Once Cherokee is configured, ensure StatusNet installer runs smoothly and detects "Fancy_URLs".
** Once installed, ensure URLS are shortened
** Login
** Submit "tweet"
** Check 'Personal Tab'. Check first tweet is present.
** Check 'Account tab'. Ensure 'Avatar' can be uploaded.

NOTES
-----
The following software packages are *required* for this software to
run correctly.

- PHP 5.2.3+. It may be possible to run this software on earlier
  versions of PHP, but many of the functions used are only available
  in PHP 5.2 or above. 5.2.6 or later is needed for XMPP background
  daemons on 64-bit platforms. PHP 5.3.x should work correctly in this
  release, but problems with some plugins are possible.
- MySQL 5.x. The StatusNet database is stored, by default, in a MySQL
  server. It has been primarily tested on 5.x servers, although it may
  be possible to install on earlier (or later!) versions. The server
  *must* support the MyISAM storage engine -- the default for most
  MySQL servers -- *and* the InnoDB storage engine.

Your PHP installation must include the following PHP extensions:

- Curl. This is for fetching files by HTTP.
- XMLWriter. This is for formatting XML and HTML output.
- MySQL. For accessing the database.
- GD. For scaling down avatar images.
- mbstring. For handling Unicode (UTF-8) encoded strings.


DB Integration:
+++++++++++++++
The patch replaces the DB form for a set of hidden fields. The values
are extracted from the database.py module.
