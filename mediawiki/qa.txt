* Make installation as VServer.
** Make sure that installer automatically places LocalSettings.php in place, displays message accordingly and sets permissions to LocalSettings.php (chmod 600) and config directory (chmod 0)
** Make sure than regular links on main page are rewritten and accessible: http://example.com/wiki/Main_Page
** Modify Main Page: Edit, discuss, etc. Make sure submissions work.
** Try Lookup to see if it yields results (check form submission is correct)
** Create another user
** Login/Logout
** Login as admin
** Test permissions: /wiki/Special:UserRights
** Delete Talk: /wiki/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&action=edit&redlink=1
** Delete Page History: /wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=history
** Delete Page: /wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=delete
** Review admin pages: /wiki/Special:SpecialPages

* Make installation as Directory.
** Make sure MediaWiki logo is displayed on first page of installation: <img src="skins/common/images/mediawiki.png" alt='The MediaWiki logo' />
** Make sure installer can run: clicking on config/index.php showed problems referencing (/config)+/index.php
** Run same set of tests as for VServer.

NOTES
-----
Following MediaWiki recommendations, Short URLs are of the form
example.com/wiki/Page_title instead of example.com/Page_title. This
follows Wikipedia's setup. According to
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL, the former case may
create an unstable URL structure and leave some page names unusable.

Not all URLs are rewritten, as recommended.

Before installing: Make config directory writable: chmod a+w config
After installing: LocalSettings.php must be moved to parent directory
and reset config dir permissions.
Make patch for that (and set messages accordingly).

MediaWiki requires PHP 5.1+ and either MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
SQLite. This is checked on their installer.

Incompatibilities: PHP 5.3.1 has a bug in it and is not supported by
MediaWiki. You should use PHP 5.3.0 or PHP 5.3.2 instead.

Extra configuration needed to work with Cherokee:
$wgScriptPath       = "/w";
$wgScript           = "$wgScriptPath/index.php";
$wgRedirectScript   = "$wgScriptPath/redirect.php";
$wgArticlePath      = "%(target_directory)s/$1";
$wgUsePathInfo      = true;
