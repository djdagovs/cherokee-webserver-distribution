After installing:
For security, you will need to reset your configure.php files located in the /admin/includes/ and /includes/ folders back to read-only mode before allowing people to access your store.
Additionally, you'll want to remove or rename the /zc_install folder so that someone can't re-install your shop again and wipe out your database! Warnings will appear until the folder has been removed or renamed. 

Also, WARNINGS appear and ADMIN section is not accessible until it is renamed:

A - Edit /admin/includes/configure.php

Using your FTP program, download a copy of your /admin/includes/configure.php file to your computer.
Using a simple text editor like notepad (or better yet, use Notepad++ or TextWrangler), change all instances of admin to your chosen new admin folder-name.

For maximum security, you may want to consider that new folder name should include numbers and a combination of upper and lower case letters. The longer you make this folder's name the more secure it will be.

When editing, make sure you leave all the / (slashes) alone.

Change this section:

 define('DIR_WS_ADMIN', '/admin/');
 define('DIR_WS_CATALOG', '/');
 define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_ADMIN', '/admin/');
 define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG', '/');


And this section:

 define('DIR_FS_ADMIN', '/home/mystore.com/www/public/admin/');
 define('DIR_FS_CATALOG', '/home/mystore.com/www/public/');


You will end up with something that looks like this:

 define('DIR_WS_ADMIN', '/mysecretadminarea/');
 define('DIR_WS_CATALOG', '/');
 define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_ADMIN', '/mysecretadminarea/');
 define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG', '/');


And:

 define('DIR_FS_ADMIN', '/home/mystore.com/www/public/mysecretadminarea/');
 define('DIR_FS_CATALOG', '/home/mystore.com/www/public/');


Now, you must upload the changes back to the server, using your FTP program.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Your configure.php file should be set as Read-Only for normal use. So, you'll need to make it Writable before you'll be able to upload/save your changes to the file.  (In *some* cases, your server might require you to DELETE the file from your server before you can upload the edited version to replace it.)
Be sure to make it Read-Only again when finished.  Often you can right-click the file in your FTP program and change the permissions settings there.  There's another FAQ article on how to change file permissions on different hosting servers.


B - Rename the Admin folder
Using your FTP software or your webhost's File Manager, find your Zen Cartâ„¢ /admin/ directory. Rename the directory to match the settings you just made in step A.
