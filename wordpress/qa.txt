NOTES:
# On updates, WP creates a temporary file and confirms that the file
# just created is owned by the same user that owns the script currently
# being run.
# Those scripts are (ATM):
#   wp-admin/plugin-install.php
#   wp-admin/theme-install.php
#   wp-admin/install.php
#   wp-admin/upgrade.php
#   wp-admin/ms-upgrade-network.php
#   wp-admin/update-core.php
# Workaround for semaless updates: chown



Dependencies:
	yum install php php-mysql
	apt-get install php5-cgi php5-mysql
