NOTES
-----
Three directories need write permissions: files, store and cache,
images/avatars/upload/, and config.php file. Their installer chmods
directories to 777 upon completion, so it has to own them.

It provides no URL rewriting functionality. Will leave it like that
for now.

Languages have 3 files, although some are missing for several
languages.

Upon installation, the '/install' directory has to be
deleted/renamed. If this directory is still present, only the
Administration Control Panel (ACP) will be accessible.

patch-01-fixinstallation.diff does:
   Rename directory to install.market_moved
   Change permissions of install.market_moved to 000
   Add message informing that the Market has done the task for them.


DB customization:
Providing a prefilled config file doesn't work because some tables
must be created by the installer (and simply dumping a DB schema is
not enough). The required DB fields are prepopulated by modifying the
installer.
