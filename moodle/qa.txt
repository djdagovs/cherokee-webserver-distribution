* Make installation as VServer.
** Ensure installation can proceed (it can't if there are permission problems).
** Ensure no warnings appear after first admin login (cron, etc).
** Create course
** Access course

* Make installation as Directory.
** Ensure the suggested moodledata is correct (the patch should do this, as it normally displays ${app_root}/..
** Ensure no insecure-directory message is shown in Admin Panel (patch)
** Perform same tests as before

NOTES
-----
Data is stored by default at ${app_root}/moodledata. Create and give permissions.
That is default for VServer installation. Directory install suggests ${app_root}/..
(and complains later on). This is taken care of in the patch.

Creates ${app_root}/moodle/config.php (needs write permissions) (cannot be present at the beginning).

Extensions required (and checked during configuration):
unicode		support
database	mysql	version 4.1.16
php		version 4.3.0
php_extension	pcre

No Short URL capabilities whatsoever (no redirections needed).

Aditional checks that we could perform for future versions:
-----------------------------------------------------------
php.ini settings:
magic_quotes_gpc = 1    (preferred but not necessary)
magic_quotes_runtime = 0    (necessary)
file_uploads = 1
session.auto_start = 0
session.bug_compat_warn = 0

Crontab: Ideally the cron.php would be run every 5-15 minutes.
*/5 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php
or
            lynx -dump http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php > /dev/null
or
            /opt/bin/php /web/moodle/admin/cron.php
