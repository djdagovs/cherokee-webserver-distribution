* Make installation as VServer.
** Ensure MySQL is accessible.
** Ensure upload/save dirs are functional.
** Everything else is DB related.

* Make installation as Directory.
** Perform same set of tests.

NOTES
-----
Requirements:
  * Web browser with cookies enabled.
  * MySQL 5.0 or newer.
  * PHP
      + You need PHP 5.2.0 or newer, with session support (see FAQ 1.31) and
        the Standard PHP Library (SPL) extension.
      + To support uploading of ZIP files, you need the PHP zip extension.
      + For proper support of multibyte strings (eg. UTF-8, which is currently
        default), you should install mbstring and ctype extensions.
      + You need GD2 support in PHP to display inline thumbnails of JPEGs
        ("image/jpeg: inline") with their original aspect ratio
      + When using the "cookie" authentication method, the mcrypt extension is
        strongly suggested for most users and is required for 64?bit machines.
        Not using mcrypt will cause phpMyAdmin to load pages significantly
        slower.
      + To support upload progress bars, see FAQ 2.9.

A configuration file is provided to enable advanced settings. Creating
tables (script/create_tables.sql) and assigning permissions to the
un-configured user is still required. In future versions we could
handle this also.
